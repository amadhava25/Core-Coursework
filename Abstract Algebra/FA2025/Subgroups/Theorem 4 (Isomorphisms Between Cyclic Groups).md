> Thm. (Isomorphisms between Cyclic Groups): Any two cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic. More specifically, 
> 	1. if $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ and $\braket{x}, \braket{y}$ are both cyclic groups of order $n$, then the map $$\begin{aligned}\varphi: &\braket{x} \to \braket{y} \\ &x^{k} \mapsto y^{k}\end{aligned}$$ is well-defined and an isomorphism; 
> 	2. if $\braket{x}$ is an infinite cyclic group, the map $$\begin{aligned}\varphi: &\mathbb{Z}\to \braket{x} \\ &k \mapsto x^{k}\end{aligned}$$ is well-defined and an isomorphism. 

## Proof: 
1. First, we must show that $\varphi$ is well-defined.
