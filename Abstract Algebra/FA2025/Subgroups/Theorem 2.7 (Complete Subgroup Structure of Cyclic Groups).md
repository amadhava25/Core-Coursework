> Thm. (Complete Subgroup Structure of Cyclic Groups): Let $H = \braket{x}$ be a cyclic group. 
> 	1. Every subgroup of $H$ is cyclic; more precisely, if $K \leq H$, then either $K = \{1\}$, or $K = \braket{x^{d}}$, where $d$ is the smallest positive integer such that $x^{d} \in K$. 
> 	2. If $|H| = \infty$, then for any distinct nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$, $\braket{x^{a}} \neq \braket{x^{b}}$. Furthermore, for every integer $m$, $\braket{x^{m}} = \braket{x^{|m|}}$, where $|m|$ is the absolute value of $m$. 
> 	3. If $|H| = n < \infty$, then for each positive integer $a$ dividing $n$, there is a unique subgroup of $H$ of order $a$. This subgroup is the cyclic group $\braket{x^{d}}$, where $d = \frac{n}{a}$.
