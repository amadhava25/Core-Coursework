> Def. (Subgroup): Let $G$ be a group. The subset $H$ of $G$ is a *subgroup* of $G$ if $H$ is a group under the operation in $G$. If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, we write $H \leq G$. 

## Examples:
1. Let $G$ be any group. Then the sets $H = G$ and $H = \{1\}$ are subgroups of $G$ (the latter called the *trivial subgroup*). 
2. $\mathbb{Z} < \mathbb{Q} < \mathbb{R}$ under the operation of addition. 
3. If $G = D_{2n}$, then the set $\{1, r, r^{2}, \ldots, r^{n - 1}\}$ is a subgroup of $G$ of order $n$.
