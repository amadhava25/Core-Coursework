> Def. (Generators of a Group): A subset $S$ of elements of a group $G$ is called the *generators of the group $G$* iff every element in $G$ can be written as a (finite) product of elements of $S$ and their inverses. Then $S$ is said to *generate* $G$.

## Examples:
1. The integer $1$ generates the additive group $\mathbb{Z}$. 
2. The set $S = \{r, s\}$ generates the dihedral group $D_{2n}$.
