> Def. (Order of an Element): Let $G$ be a group and $x \in G$. Then the order of $x$, denoted $|x|$, is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $x^{n} = 1$. If no such $n$ exists, then $|x| = \infty$, and $x$ is said to be of *infinite order*. 

## Examples:
1. An element has order $1$ iff it is the identity. 
2. In the additive groups, $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{Q}$, every nonzero element is of infinite order. 
3. In the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Z}\setminus \{0\}, \mathbb{Q}\setminus\{0\}$, $\mathbb{R}\setminus \{0\}$, $-1$ has order 2.
