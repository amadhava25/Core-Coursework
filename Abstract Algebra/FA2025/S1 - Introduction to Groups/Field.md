> Def. (Field): A set $F$ together with two binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$ on $F$ such that $(F, +)$ is an abelian group (with identity $0$) and $(F \setminus \{0\}, \cdot)$ is an abelian group (with identity 1) and such that the following distributive law holds: $$a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$$ for all $a, b, c \in F$.
