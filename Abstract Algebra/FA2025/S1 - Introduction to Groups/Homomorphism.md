> Def. (Homomorphism): Let $(G, \star)$ and $(H, \diamond)$ be groups. A map $\varphi: G \to H$ such that $$\varphi(x \star y) = \varphi(x) \diamond \varphi(y)$$ for all $x, y \in G$ is called a *homomorphism*. 

## Examples:
1. Consider the function $\varphi: (\mathbb{R},+) \to (\mathbb{R} \setminus\{0\}, \cdot)$ defined by $\varphi(x) = \exp(x)$. Then $\varphi$ is a homomorphism since for any $x, y\in \mathbb{R}$, $\varphi(x + y) = \exp(x + y) = \exp(x) \cdot\exp(y)$.
