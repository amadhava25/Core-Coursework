> Prop: (Uniqueness of Identities and Inverses): If $G$ is a group under the operation $\star$, then 
> 	1. the identity of $G$ is unique; 
> 	2. for each $a \in G$, $a^{-1}$ is uniquely determined; 
> 	3. $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$ for all $a \in G$; 
> 	4. $(a \star b)^{-1} = b^{-1} \star a^{-1}$; 
> 	5. for any $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n} \in G$, the value of $a_{1} \star a_{2} \star \dotsm \star a_{n}$ is independent of how the expression is bracketed (this is called the *generalized associative law*). 

## Proof:
