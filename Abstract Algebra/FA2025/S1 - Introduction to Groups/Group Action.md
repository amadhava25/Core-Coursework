> Def. (Group Action): A *group action* of a group $G$ on a set $A$ is a map from $G \times A \to A$ (written as $g \cdot a$ for all $g \in G$ and $a \in A$) satisfying the following properties:
> 	1. $g_{1} \cdot (g_{2} \cdot a) = (g_{1}g_{2}) \cdot a$; 
> 	2. $1 \cdot a = a$;

## Properties:
1. Let $G$ act on the set $A$. For each fixed $g \in G$, we get a map $\sigma_{g}$ defined by $$\begin{align} &\sigma_{g}: A \to A; \\ &\sigma_{g}(a) = g \cdot a. \end{align}$$
	Then 
		1. for each fixed $g \in G$, $\sigma_{g}$ is a permutation of $A$, and 
		2. the map from $G$ to $S_{A}$ defined by $g \mapsto \sigma_{g}$ is a homomorphism.
