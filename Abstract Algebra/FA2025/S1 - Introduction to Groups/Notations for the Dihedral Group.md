> Not. (Notations for the Dihedral Group): Fix a regular $n$-gon centered at the origin and label the vertices from $1$ to $n$ clockwise about the origin. Then $r$ represents the clockwise rotation about the origin through an angle of $2\pi/n$ radians; $s$ represents the reflection about the line of symmetry passing through vertex $1$ and the origin. 

## Properties: 
1. $1, r, r^{2}, \ldots, r^{n - 1}$ are all distinct and $r^{n} = 1$, so $|r| = n$; 
2. $|s| = 2$; 
3. $s \neq r^{i}$ for any $i$; 
4. $sr^{i} \neq sr^{j}$ for all $0 \leq i, j \leq n -1$, with $i \neq j$, so $$D_{2n} = \{1, r, r^{2}, \ldots, r^{n - 1}, s, sr, sr^{2}, \ldots, sr^{n - 1}\};$$
5. $rs = sr^{-1}$;
6. $r^{i}s = sr^{-i}$ for all $0 \leq i \leq n$.
