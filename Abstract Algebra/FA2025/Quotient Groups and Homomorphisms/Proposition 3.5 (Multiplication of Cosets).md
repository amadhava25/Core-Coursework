> Prop. (Multiplication of Left Cosets): Let $G$ be a group and $N \leq G$. 
> 	1. The operation on the left cosets of $G$ defined by $$(uN) \cdot (vN) = (uv)N$$ is well-defined iff $gng^{-1} \in N$ for all $g \in G$ and $n \in N$. 
> 	2. If the above operation is well-defined then the set of all left cosets of $G$ is a group under the operation, with identity given by $1 \cdot N$; the inverse of $gN$ is the element $g^{-1}N$.
