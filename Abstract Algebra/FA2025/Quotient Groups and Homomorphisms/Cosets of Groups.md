> Def. (Cosets of Groups): For any $N \leq G$ and $g \in G$, let $$gN = \{gn: n \in N\} \qquad \text{and} \qquad Ng = \{ng: n \in N\}.$$ Then these sets are the *left* and *right* cosets of $N$ in $G$. Any element of a coset is a *representative* of the coset. 

## Properties:
1. By Proposition 3.2 (Fibers of a Homomorphism), the fibers of a homomorphism are the left cosets (and right cosets) of the kernel.
