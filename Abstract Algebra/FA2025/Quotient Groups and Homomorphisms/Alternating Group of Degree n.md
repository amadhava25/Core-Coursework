> Def. (The Alternating Group, $A_{n}$): The *alternating group of degree $n$*, denoted $A_{n}$, is the kernel of the homomorphism $\epsilon$; i.e., $A_{n}$ is the set of all even permutations in $S_{n}$. 

## Properties:
1. $|A_{n}| = 2^{-1}n!$. To see this, note by Theorem 3.16 (First Isomorphism Theorem), that $S_{n}/A_{n} \cong \epsilon(S_{n}) = \{\pm 1\}$, such that $|S_{n}/A_{n}| = 2$. Then, by Theorem 3.8 (Lagrange's Theorem), it follows that $|A_{n}| = |S_{n}|/|S_{n}/A_{n}| = 2^{-1}n!$.
