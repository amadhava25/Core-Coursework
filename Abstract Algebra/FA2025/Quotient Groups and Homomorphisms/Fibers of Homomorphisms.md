> Def. (Fibers of Homomorphisms): If $\varphi: G \to H$ is a homomorphism, the *fibers* of $\varphi$ are the sets of elements of $G$ projecting to single elements of $H$. 

## Properties:
1. One can turn the set of all fibers of $\varphi$ into a group under the following operation. Let $X_{a}$ be the fiber of $\varphi$ over $a \in  H$ and $X_{b}$ be the fiber of $\varphi$ over $b \in H$. Then define $X_{a} \cdot X_{b} = X_{ab}$ to be the fiber over $ab$.
