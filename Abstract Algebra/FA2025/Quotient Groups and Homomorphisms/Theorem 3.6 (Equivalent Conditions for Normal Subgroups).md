> Thm. (Equivalent Conditions for Normal Subgroups): Let $N \leq G$.  The following are equivalent: 
> 	1. $N \unlhd G$; 
> 	2. $N_{G}(N) = G$, where $N_{G}(N)$ is the normalizer of $N$;
> 	3. $gN = Ng$ for all $g \in G$;
> 	4. the operation on the left cosets of $N$ in $G$ as described in Proposition 3.5 (Multiplication of Cosets) makes the set of left cosets into a group;
> 	5. $gNg^{-1} \subseteq N$ for all $g \in G$.
