> Thm. (Product of Left Cosets of the Kernel): Let $G$ be a group and $K$ the kernel of some group homomorphism from $G$ to another group. Then the set whose elements are the left cosets of $K$ in $G$ with operation defined by $uK \circ vK = (uv)K$ forms a group, denoted $G/K$. This operation is well-defined in the sense that if $u_{1} \in uK$ and $v_{1} \in vK$, then $u_{1}v_{1}K = uvK$.

>The same statement is true for right cosets instead of left cosets.
