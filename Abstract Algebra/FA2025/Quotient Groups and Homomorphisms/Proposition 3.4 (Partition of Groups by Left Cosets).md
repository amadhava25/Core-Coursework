> Prop. (Partition of Groups by Left Cosets): Let $N$ be any subgroup of the group $G$. The set of left cosets of $N$ in $G$ forms a partition of $G$. Furthermore, for all $u, v \in G$, $uN = vN$ if and only if $v^{-1}u \in N$. In particular, $uN = vN$ iff $u$ and $v$ are representatives of the same coset.
