> Def. (Transposition): A 2-cycle, $(a_{1}\;a_{2})$ is called a transposition. 

## Properties:
1. For every $n \geq 3$, every element of $S_{n}$ may be written as the product of transpositions. 
	Proof: It is easy to verify that for all $(a_{1}\;a_{2}\;a_{3}\; \dotsm a_{m}) \in S_{n}$, $$(a_{1}\;a_{2}\;a_{3}\; \dotsm a_{m}) = (a_{1}\;a_{m})(a_{1}\;a_{m -1})(a_{1}\;a_{m - 2})\dotsm (a_{1}\;a_{2}).$$
