> Def. (Even and Odd Permutations): Let $\sigma \in S_{n}$. 
> 	1. $\epsilon(\sigma)$, as defined when building intuition for the parity of a permutation, is called the *sign* of $\sigma$;
> 	2. $\sigma$ is an *even permutation* if $\epsilon(\sigma) = 1$, and an *odd permutation* if $\epsilon(\sigma) = -1$.
