> Cor. (Classification of Prime Order Groups): If $G$ is a group of prime order $p$, then $G$ is cyclic, hence $G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p}$. 

## Proof:
1. Let $G$ be a group of prime order $p$ and $x \in G$ be a non-identity element in $G$. Consider the subgroup $\braket{x}$ generated by $x$. By Theorem 3.8 (Lagrange's Theorem), either $|\braket{x}| = 1$ or $|\braket{x}| = p$ since the only divisors of a prime integer are $1$ and itself. Since $x \neq 1, |x| \neq 1 \iff |\braket{x}| \neq 1$. Therefore, $|\braket{x}| = p = |G| \iff G = \braket{x}$. I.e., $G$ is a cyclic group. 
2. Since $G$ is a cyclic group of order $p$, $G = \{1, x, x^{2}, \ldots, x^{p -1}\}$ for some $x \in G$. Consider the function $\varphi: \mathbb{Z}_{p} \to G$ defined by $\varphi(n) = x^{n}$. 
	1. It is clear to see that $\varphi$ is surjective: if $x^{n} \in G$ for some $0 \leq n \leq p -1$, then $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{p}$ and $\varphi(n) = x^{n} \in G$. 
	2. Suppose $\varphi(n) = \varphi(m) \iff x^{n} = x^{m} \iff x^{n - m} = 1 \iff p \mid (n - m)$. If $p \mid (n - m)$, then $n \equiv m \pmod{p}$, which means that $n = m$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. Therefore, $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is injective. 
	3. That $\varphi$ is a homomorphism is quite clear to see. 
	Therefore, $\varphi$ is a group isomorphism, and so $G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p}$.
