> Def. (Normal Subgroups): Let $G$ be a group and $N \leq G$. 
> 	1. The element $gng^{-1}$ is called the *conjugate* of $n \in N$ by $g$. 
> 	2. The set $gNg^{-1}$ is called the *conjugate of $N$* by $g$. 
> 	3. The element $g$ is said to *normalize* $N$ if $gNg^{-1} = N$. 
> 	4. $N$ is said to be be a *normal subgroup of $G$* (denoted $N \trianglelefteq G$) if $gNg^{-1} = N$ for all $g \in G$.
