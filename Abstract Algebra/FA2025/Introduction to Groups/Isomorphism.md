> Def. (Isomorphism): The map $\varphi: G \to H$ is called an isomorphism, and $G$ is said to be isomorphic to $H$ iff: 
> 	1. $\varphi$ is a homomorphism, and 
> 	2. $\varphi$ is bijective. 

## Examples:
1. The map $\varphi: (\mathbb{R}, +) \to (\mathbb{R} \setminus\{0\}, \cdot)$ defined by $\varphi(x) = \exp(x)$ is not an isomorphism since it is not surjective. On the other hand, the map $\varphi'(x) = \exp(x): (\mathbb{R}, +) \to (\mathbb{R}^{+}, \times)$ is an isomorphism.
