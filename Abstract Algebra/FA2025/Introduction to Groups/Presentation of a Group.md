> Def. (Presentation of a Group): If $G$ is generated by a subset $S$ and there is come collection of relations, $R_{1}, R_{2}, \ldots, R_{m}$ such that any relation among the elements of $S$ can be deduced from these, we call the generators and relations a *presentation* of $G$ and write, $$G = \braket{S \mid R_{1}, \ldots, R_{m}}.$$

## Examples:
1. E.g., a presentation for the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ is, $D_{2n} = \braket{\{r, s\}, r^{n} = 1, s^{2} = 1, rs = sr^{-1}}$.
