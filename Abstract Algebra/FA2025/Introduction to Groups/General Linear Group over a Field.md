> Def. ($GL_{n}(F)$ for a field $F$): Let $F$ be an arbitrary field, and define the set $$GL_{n}(F) \coloneqq \{A: A \text{ is an $n \times n$ matrix with entries from $F$ and $\det(A) \neq 0$}\}.$$ Then $GL_{n}(F)$ is a group, called the *general linear group over the field $F$*, or the *general linear group of degree $n$*.
